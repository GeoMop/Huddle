    "(for projects GeoMop and Flow123d)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on [The Best of the Best Practices (BOBP) Guide for Python][BOBP].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Values\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Build tools for others that you want to be built for you.\" - Kenneth Reitz\n",
    "- \"The perfect is the enemy of the good.\" - Linus Torvalds\n",
    "- \"Beautiful is better than ugly.\" - [PEP 20][]\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Development Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Readability counts.\" - [PEP 20][]\n",
    "- \"Anybody can fix anything.\" - [Khan Academy Development Docs][]\n",
    "- Fix each [broken window](http://www.artima.com/intv/fixit2.html) (bad design, wrong decision, or poor code) *as soon as it is discovered*.\n",
    "- \"Now is better than never.\" - [PEP 20][]\n",
    "- Test ruthlessly. Write docs for new features.\n",
    "- Even more important that Test-Driven Development--*Human-Driven Development*\n",
    "- These guidelines may--and probably will--change.\n",
    "- Avoid preliminary optimization. (However desing with memory access in mind.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow [PEP 8][], when sensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables, functions, methods, packages, modules  \n",
    "  `lower_case_with_underscores`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Classes and Exceptions    \n",
    "  `CapWords`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Protected methods and internal functions  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### General Naming Guidelines \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid single-letter variables** (eg. `l`, `O`, `I`). \n",
    "\n",
    "  *Exception*: In very short blocks, when the meaning is clearly visible from the immediate context\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Use 4 spaces--never tabs. Enough said.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Line lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't stress over it. 80-100 characters is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation (WIP)\n",
    "*Extract from [PEP 257][]'s docstring guidelines. [reStructured Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) and [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) can help to enforce these standards.*\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use action words (\"Return\") rather than descriptions (\"Returns\").\n",
    "- \"Make every word tell\", [The Elements of Style][] (1918), William Strunk\n",
    "\n",
    "## On comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Use them sparingly. Prefer code readability to writing a lot of comments. Often, small methods are more effective than comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_stop_sign(sign):\n",

    "\n",
    "## Explicit function parameters\n",
    "No:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.sum(array, 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.sum(array, axis=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import entire modules instead of individual symbols within a module. \n",
    "  For example, for a top-level module `canteen` that has a file `canteen/sessions.py`,\n",

    "    *Exception*: For third-party code where documentation explicitly says to import individual symbols.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Avoids circular imports. See \n",

    "    2. Third-party imports\n",
    "    3. Local source tree imports\n",

    "\n",
    "## For Discusion\n",
    "- Reverse naming notation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Strive for 100% code coverage, but don't get obsess over the coverage score.\n",
    "In particular true for libraries, and more general parts of code. \n",
    "Try to make most of the code fit to such high standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General testing guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use long, descriptive names. This often obviates the need for doctrings in test methods.\n",
    "- Tests should be isolated. Don't interact with a real database or network. Use a separate test database that gets torn down or use mock objects.\n",
    "- Prefer [factories](https://github.com/rbarrois/factory_boy) to fixtures.\n",
    "- Never let incomplete tests pass, else you run the risk of forgetting about them. Instead, add a placeholder like `assert False, \"TODO: finish me\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on one tiny bit of functionality.\n",
    "- Should be fast, but a slow test is better than no test.\n",
    "- It often makes sense to have one testcase class for a single class or model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "import factories\n",
    "\n",
    "class PersonTest(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "    def setUp(self):\n",
    "        self.person = factories.PersonFactory()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_has_age_in_dog_years(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(self.person.dog_years, self.person.age / 7)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional tests are higher level tests that are closer to how an end-user would interact with your application. They are typically used for web and GUI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write tests as scenarios. Testcase and test method names should read like a scenario description.\n",
    "- Use comments to write out stories, *before writing the test code*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class TestAUser(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_can_write_a_blog_post(self):\n",
    "        # Goes to the her dashboard\n",
